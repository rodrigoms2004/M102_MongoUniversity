// Lab - $unwind
// Problem:

// Let's use our increasing knowledge of the Aggregation Framework to explore our movies collection in more detail. 
// We'd like to calculate how many movies every cast member has been in and get an average imdb.rating for each cast member.

// What is the name, number of movies, and average rating (truncated to one decimal) 
// for the cast member that has been in the most number of movies with English as an available language?

// Provide the input in the following order and format

// { "_id": "First Last", "numFilms": 1, "average": 1.1 }

db.movies.aggregate([
    { $unwind: "$cast" },
    { $group: {
        _id: "$cast",
            "numFilms": { $sum: 1 },
            "average": { $avg: "$imdb.rating" }
    }},
    { $sort: { "numFilms": -1 }},
    { $limit: 1}
])

// { "_id" : "John Wayne", "numFilms" : 107, "average" : 6.424299065420561 }
